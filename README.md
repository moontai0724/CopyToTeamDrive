# CopyToTeamDrive

First, please don't misled by the name, this is a script that can copy a whole folder into another folder, includes team drive.
That is because team drive is also a folder, it has a folder id in the URL.

URL is looks like this: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/SfylswnasvBdCgyIOsF7 (it's fake.)
If you are confusing about what is a folder id, in this example, "SfylswnasvBdCgyIOsF7" is the folder id, it can be shorts, or it can be very very long and complex.

**Please notice that this script does not check whether you have permission to access and manage target folder or not.**

### Before execute, please fill in target folder id and source folder id.
